          <p>Yennefer is a sorceress who is Geralt's true love, and she has also been a motherly figure toward Ciri. She possesses great power and the ability to teleport â€” fun fact, witchers hate portals. She's known for her beauty, which her incredibly high skill in magic likely contributed to. While Yennefer and Geralt were initially lovers, a crucial battle that they lost versus the Wild Hunt, a large antagonistic group of powerful elves who want to capture Ciri, resulted in Geralt trading Yennefer's life, allowing her to live, for all of his memories. Because of this, Geralt initially forgets that he ever loved Yennefer, which makes things extremely difficult because they're then forcibly separated from one another for quite some time.</p>
