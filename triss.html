          <p>Triss is another legendary sorceress from a completely different nation than Yennefer, who Geralt falls in love with due to his loss of memories after saving Yennefer. This occurs because Triss is one of the first people to find Geralt unconscious in the middle of a forest after he'd lost his memories. Triss played a crucial role in helping Geralt gather his bearings and heal after his battle with the Wild Hunt. Triss also took care of Ciri for some time and is like an older sister to her. Although Triss and Yennefer are both sorceresses, their powers are quite different. Evidently, there is a small love triangle between Triss and Yennefer. In the Witcher video game series, the player is able to romance either character based on choices they make throughout the game. In the books, Triss is a slightly different character than in the games. It will be very interesting to see how the Netflix series characterizes Triss compared to other adaptations.</p>
