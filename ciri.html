          <p>Ciri is the princess of Cintra, a high-status nation. She is born into royalty, but her ancestry goes to elven species, who are discriminated against by humans but quite powerful, capable of utilizing magic. She has a unique gift from her elven ancestry, which gives her divine power as the "elder child". She does not know how to use it; however, some of those who are aware of this seek to capture her and control her incredible power for themselves. As Geralt is incredibly close with her and has trained her, he has sworn to protect her, and thinks that Ciri may decide to take the path of the witcher. At some point, Geralt and Ciri get separated, however, and no one knows where Ciri is.</p>
