          <p>Geralt of Rivia is the main protagonist, who is a witcher. A witcher is an individual who has undergone extensive mental and physical training, as well as participated in witcher school rituals like consuming lethal potions. Once someone graduates from a witcher school, they become a witcher. Witchers are considered cold-hearted, emotionless, and ruthless. The purpose of the training is to become an expert monster hunter, through which witchers make a nice living and gain fame/notoriety.
          
          Geralt himself has shown to not be cold-hearted, and he makes many interesting friends and even has romantic encounters throughout his journey. As Geralt is one of the most famous witchers in the world, he is entrusted to look after and train princess Ciri, with whom he develops a father-daughter-like relationship. </p>
